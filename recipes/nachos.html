    </p>

    <h4>Incredients:</h4>
    <ul>
       <li>aluminum foil</li>
       <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
       <li>3/4 cup water</li>
       <li>1 (1.25 ounce) package taco seasoning mix</li>
       <li>1 (18 ounce) package restaurant-style tortilla chips</li>
       <li>1 cup shredded sharp Cheddar cheese, or more to taste</li>
       <li>1 (15.5 ounce) can refried beans</li>
       <li>1 (10 ounce) can pitted black olives, drained and chopped</li>
       <li>1 cup salsa</li>
       <li>1 cup sour cream, or more to taste</li>
       <li>4 green onions, diced</li>
       <li>1 (4 ounce) can sliced jalapeno peppers, drained</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Step-By-Step Instructions:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven broiler. Set the oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.</li>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Cook and stir ground beef in a skillet over medium heat until meat is crumbly and no longer pink, 5 to 10 minutes.
            Drain excess grease. Stir in water and taco seasoning mix; simmer until beef mixture has thickened, 8 to 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Spread tortilla chips on the prepared baking sheet. Top with Cheddar cheese, then dot with refried beans and ground beef mixture.</li>
        <li>Broil in the preheated oven until cheese is melted, 3 to 5 minutes. Top nachos with olives, salsa, sour cream, green onions, and jalapeño peppers.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>What Goes On Nachos? </h4>
    <p>
        These nachos are topped with seasoned ground beef, shredded Cheddar cheese, canned refried beans, 
        chopped tomatoes, canned black olives, salsa, sour cream, green onions, and sliced jalapeño peppers.
    </p>
    <p>
        Other delicious options include shredded chicken, barbacoa, guacamole, cotija cheese, corn, pico de gallo, 
        shredded lettuce, diced onions, pickled red onions, and/or black beans.
    </p>
    
    <h4>How to Store Leftover Nachos:</h4>
    <p>
        Nachos don't make the best leftovers, as the tortilla chips will get soggy quickly. If you do have leftover assembled nachos, though, 
        you can store them in an airtight container in the fridge for up to three days.   
    </p>

    <h4>How to Reheat Nachos:</h4>
    <p>
        Reheat nachos in the oven (not the microwave) for the best results. Spread them in a single layer on a prepared baking sheet, then bake at 350 degrees 
        F until the nachos are thoroughly hot. Adding a sprinkle of shredded cheese before reheating can help the nachos taste fresher.
