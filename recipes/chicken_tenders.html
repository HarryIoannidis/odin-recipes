    <h4>How Long to Bake Chicken Tenders:</h4>
    <p>
        This recipe will produce perfectly baked chicken tenders in under 20 minutes in an oven preheated to 450 degrees F.
        When the chicken tenderloins are done, the juices will run clear and an instant read thermometer inserted 
        into the center should read at least 165 degrees F.

    <h4>Why Bake Chicken Tenders?</h4>
    <p>
        There are plenty of reasons to make baked chicken tenders instead of breaking out your deep fryer: 
        They require a lot less oil than their deep-fried counterparts, which makes them a lighter alternative. 
        Plus, this oven-baked method is incredibly easy (not to mention it makes cleanup a breeze).
