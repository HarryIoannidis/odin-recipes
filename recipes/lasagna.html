        When John Chandler submitted this lasagna recipe to Allrecipes more than 20 years ago, he had no idea how successful it would become. 
        One of our top-performing recipes of all time, World's Best Lasagna racks up more than 7 million views per year and has ranked among the most popular lasagna recipes on the internet for two decades. 
        Unfortunately, John unexpectedly passed away at 53 years old

        The assembled lasagna should take about 50 minutes to cook in an oven preheated to 375 degrees F. 
        Cover it with foil for the first 25 minutes, then let it cook uncovered for the final 25 minutes. 
        Also, it's important to let the lasagna rest at room temperature for about 15 minutes before you cut into it.
