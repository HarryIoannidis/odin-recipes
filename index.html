    <h2>Chicken Tenders</h2>
    <p>
        These baked chicken tenders have a deliciously crispy panko bread crumb coating for that extra crunch factor without the guilt of frying! 
        You can marinate the tenders in light buttermilk in the refrigerator for 1 hour instead of dipping in the beaten egg.

    <h2>Nachos</h2>
    <p>
        These homemade nachos are great for game day. This recipe makes a huge meal-sized tray 
        of nachos loaded with taco-seasoned ground beef, refried beans, salsa, jalape√±os, and cheese.
